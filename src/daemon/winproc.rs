//! Windows-only process-table helpers.
//!
//! Windows has no ConPTY analogue of a Unix "foreground process group", so the
//! daemon can't ask the pty who's in front (that's why `pane`'s macOS/Linux
//! foreground queries have no Windows counterpart). What it *can* do is walk the
//! process table from the shell's own pid. Two pane operations need that:
//!
//!   - **titling** a pane by the command running under the shell
//!     ([`foreground_name`]), so Windows tabs show `git` / `node` / … instead of
//!     staying blank; and
//!   - **hangup** ([`descendants`]), because `portable-pty`'s Windows `kill`
//!     terminates only the shell process — its children would otherwise be
//!     reparented and linger, some still attached to the ConPTY, which keeps the
//!     pane reader's blocking read from ever hitting EOF.
//!
//! The Win32 surface is a thin [`snapshot`]/[`terminate`] pair; all the tree
//! logic is pure over a plain [`Proc`] list and unit-tested without a live
//! process. Note that reading another process's *cwd* is deliberately not here:
//! it needs PEB traversal via `ReadProcessMemory`, which is undocumented and
//! fragile across bitness/elevation — so cwd on Windows stays sourced from OSC 7
//! (see `pane::foreground_cwd`).
