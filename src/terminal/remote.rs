//! Client-side `RemoteTerminal`: the GUI half of the persistent-daemon design.
//!
//! It owns **nothing but a socket and a local mirror**. The PTY + child live in
//! the daemon (`daemon::pane`); we hold one Unix-domain-socket connection to it
//! (one connection == one pane) and a local `alacritty_terminal::Term` that we
//! feed from the bytes the daemon replays. The render path is the usual one (an
//! `ansi::Processor` advancing a `Term`); only the *source* of those bytes is a
//! "daemon socket" rather than a "PTY master fd".
//!
//! `RemoteTerminal` exposes the fields the view reads directly (`term`, `events`,
//! `palette`, `exited`) and the methods it calls (`write`, `resize`,
//! `foreground_cwd`, `at_prompt`, `size`), so the view treats it like any local
//! terminal.
//!
//! Threading model: a dedicated reader thread blocking-reads
//! framed [`DaemonMsg`]s and advances the local `Term`, while UI-thread calls
//! (`write`/`resize`) push framed [`ClientMsg`]s out the write half. Because both
//! the reader thread and the UI thread touch the connection, we `try_clone` the
//! stream into independent read/write halves and guard the write half with a
//! `Mutex`.
